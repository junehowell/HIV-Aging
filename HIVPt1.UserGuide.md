#**Part One: Introduction**

##**Chapter 1: User guide**

###**1-1. Purpose and scope**

a.	*Purpose*: The Aging Well with HIV Manual is for people aging with chronic HIV. It describes common health problems that come with chronic HIV infection. Since many of these problems cannot be cured at present, the manual focuses on how to manage them, so that you can age well despite them.  

b.	*Scope*: To keep the manual easy to read, we limit each chapter to 3 sections: 
				1.	What is the problem? 
				2.	Why is it important?
				3.	What should I do about it?
The manual leaves out contents you do not need. For example, it does not include tests that will be ordered, or pills used to treat the disease. This is because your doctor will figure these out with you.

###**1-2. Outline of the manual**

Part one gives brief details about HIV and its general effects on aging. Part two outlines the most common problems with chronic HIV. Each chapter in part two is divided into 3 sections:

a.	*The problem and its importance*: This section explains what the problems are, and how these problems are different in people aging with HIV compared to others. Then, it explains why these problems are important to you by describing their effects on daily life or functions. 

b.	*What to do with your doctor*: This section alerts you to things you need to do with your doctor to solve the problems. You should read this section before going to the doctor, or show it to the doctor during your visit.

c.	*What to do on your own*: This section focuses on things you need to do on your own to solve the problems. Your doctor can guide you through this section and answer questions you may have. But, you will have to take the steps yourself. 

###**1-3. This manual is not:**

a.	*A guide to HIV as a disease in general*: This manual does not aim to give advice on HIV in general. Instead, it focuses mostly on problems that occur in people aging with HIV and what to do about them.

b.	*A replacement for doctors’ visits*: The manual gives general advice on HIV and aging issues. But, it is not specific to each person and will never be as good as your doctor’s advice. Always follow doctor’s advice, even if it is not the same as the advice in this manual.
