#Concept

####Why we created the manual

We believe that information empowers people. It empowers those who give it, and those who receive it.

####How do we empower as many people as possible?

- *Access*: We believe information must be simple and free of charge, so that people with any level of education or income can use it. 

- *Self-reliance*: We believe people should both give and receive information. So, we designed this manual to be maintained by the people who read it. 

####How the manual works

- *The manual is easy to read*: The reading level for this manual will not be higher than 6th grade. See our page on [editing rules].

- *The manual is free*: We will never charge you for the content. See our [license](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) page.

- *The manual is maintained by its readers*: Information changes as we learn more about HIV and aging. We want to empower *you* to teach others about these new changes through our manual.

####How to get involved with manual maintenance

- *Suggest edits*: Anyone can suggest edits, to any part of the manual. If you see something we can make better, see our page [to suggest edits]. 

- *Become curators*: For quality control, curators review edits submitted readers to make sure they follow our editing rules and change the manual for the better. See our page [to become curators].

- *Make donations*: We take money out of our paychecks to pay for the website. If you would like to help us keep the websites going, see our page [to make donations]. Thank you in advance!

##Editing rules to keep the manual easy to read:

- Every chapter must be shorter than 2 pages. This way, people with short focus can still read it.
- Every paragraph must be shorter than 7 lines. This way, people with short focus can still read it. If your paragraph is longer than 7 lines, try cutting it into smaller sections.
- Every word must be shorter than 12 characters AND 4 syllables. Try using shorter words with the same meaning whenever you can. The only time you can break this rule is when you need to use a specific term related to HIV. In this case, you must explain the term in words shorter than 12 characters AND 4 syllables.
- The reading skill required must not be higher than 6th grade.
