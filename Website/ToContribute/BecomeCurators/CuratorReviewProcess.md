#Curator review process

For each submission, follow these steps:

  1. When there is a submission that needs your review, you will get an email from Github. The email will be sent to the address you put in the [very short form] you filled out to become a curator.
  2. Click the link in the email. This will take you to the Github account for the manual. 
  3. 

If you have questions, [contact us] or read the [curator review FAQs].
