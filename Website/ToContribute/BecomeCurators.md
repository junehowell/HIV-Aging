#To become curators

##What are the roles of curators?

  1. *Review edits*: For quality control, curators review edits submitted by readers to make sure they change the manual for the better, using our [curator review process]. For more details, see our [curator review FAQs].

  2. *Recruit new curators*: By including new curators through our [recruiting process], we hope to empower and include as many people as possible while maintaining the quality of the manual. For more details, see our [recruiting FAQs].

For more details, see our page on [being a curator].

##How can I become curators?

To become curators, you should:

- Successfully submit *at least* 10 edits.
- Learn how to manage edits through Github. Read our [Github guide] to get started.
- Tell our readers why they can trust you as a curator by completing this [very short form]. 
- [Contact us] if you do not hear back within 2 weeks. 

We keep a clear and open process of curating our manual contents. To do this, we publish a list of curators, so people can see where our manual contents come from. See the current [list of curators] and read about who they are.
