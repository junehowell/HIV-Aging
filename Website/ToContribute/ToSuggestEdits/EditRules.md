##Editing rules to keep the manual easy to read:

- Every chapter must be shorter than 2 pages. This way, people with short focus can still read it.
- Every paragraph must be shorter than 7 lines. This way, people with short focus can still read it. If your paragraph is longer than 7 lines, try cutting it into smaller sections.
- Every word must be shorter than 12 characters AND 4 syllables. Try using shorter words with the same meaning whenever you can. The only time you can break this rule is when you need to use a specific term related to HIV. In this case, you must explain the term in words shorter than 12 characters AND 4 syllables.
- The reading skill required must not be higher than 6th grade.
