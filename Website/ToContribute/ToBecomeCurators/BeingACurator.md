- They review edits submitted by readers to make sure they change the manual for the better, using our [curator review process] (for more details, see our [curator review FAQs]). 
- They also recruit new curators to empower and include as many people as possible while maintaining the quality of the manual, based on our [recruiting process] (for more details, see our [recruiting FAQs]).
