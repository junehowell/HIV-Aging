#Aging Well with HIV Manual

##This manual is:
- For people aging with HIV: The manual describes common health problems that come with chronic HIV infection. Since many of these problems cannot be cured at present, the manual focuses on how to manage them, so that you can age well despite them.
- Focused: To keep the manual easy to read, we limit each chapter to 3 sections: 
				1. What is the problems? 
				2. Why is it important? 
				3. What should you do about it? 

- For everyone: We made this manual for people of all ages, cultures, income levels, and reading skills. To achieve this, we provide the manual for free, and keep reading skill required at the 5th grade level. If a child wants to read this manual, we want to make sure they can understand it.

##This manual is not:
- A guide to HIV as a disease in general. This would make the manual long and unfocused.
- A detailed guide on common health problems in chronic HIV. The science behind these problems are complex and not yet well understood. To describe it, the manual might become hard to understand and not everyone will be able to read it. Also, we do not need to know all the science behind it to understand what should be done.

##How to use the manual:
- Who: People aging with HIV, their loved ones, or anyone, really. 
- When: Any time, but better before doctorâ€™s visit. This way, you know what you need to talk to the doctor about.
- How: You can read it from start to finish. Or, you can pick only the chapters that apply to you. Each chapter makes sense on its own. You do not need to read prior chapters to understand it.
- Where: Read on the website. Or, if you have problems reading on the computer screen, download the PDF and print it on a white A4 paper. 

##Editing rules to keep the manual easy to read:
- Every chapter must be shorter than 2 pages. This way, people with short focus can still read it.
- Every paragraph must be shorter than 7 lines. This way, people with short focus can still read it. If your paragraph is longer than 7 lines, try cutting it into smaller sections.
- Every word must be shorter than 12 characters AND 4 syllables. Try using shorter words with the same meaning whenever you can. The only time you can break this rule is when you need to describe a specific term related to HIV. In this case, you must explain the term in words shorter than 12 characters AND 4 syllables.
